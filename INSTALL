Steps to install (requires CMake):

[..navigate to repeatseq directory..]

(1) download bamtools, place in repeatseq/ in directory named "bamtools" (https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools)
(2) download fastahack, place in repeatseq/ in directory named "fastahack" (https://github.com/ekg/fastahack)

(3) build bamtools
$ mkdir bamtools/build
$ cd bamtools/build/
$ cmake ..
$ make

(4) build repeatseq
$ cd ../..
$ make

Update:
Some folks have reported the following error after following the above instructions:
error while loading shared libraries: libbamtools.so.2.3.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Adding the bamtools path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH will resovle this issue.
