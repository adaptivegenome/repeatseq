RepeatSeq v0.5.3

1. Introduction
RepeatSeq determines genotypes for microsatellite repeats in high-throughput sequencing data. RepeatSeq is available
through the Virginia Tech non-commerical license. For more details on the license and use, see license.txt included in
this distribution.

2. Setup and Installation
See INSTALL for install instructions

3. Required Input
RepeatSeq requires a BAM file, a FASTA file, and a region file as the minimal parameters. 

4. Optional Input

The user to specify a number of command-line options to customize the behavior of RepeatSeq:

Command-line Options: 
	-r   	    use only a specific read length or range of read lengths (e.g. LENGTH or MIN:MAX)
	-L          required number of reference matching bases BEFORE the repeat [3]
	-R          required number of reference matching bases AFTER the repeat [3]
	-M          minimum mapping quality for a read to be used for allele determination
	-multi      exclude reads flagged with the XT:A:R tag
	-pp         exclude reads that are not properly paired (for PE reads only)
	-error      manually override the RepeatSeq error model and set a constant error rate [0.05]
    	-haploid    assume a haploid rather than diploid genome
	-repeatseq  write .repeatseq file (**see pdf documentation for more information**)
	-calls      write .calls file (**see pdf documentation for more information**)
	-t          include user-defined tag in the output filename
	-o          number of flanking bases to output from each read

5. Running RepeatSeq

Usage: repeatseq [options] <in.bam> <in.fasta> <in.regions>,

If an improper command line option is found, RepeatSeq will exit and print usage information.
