RepeatSeq v0.6.4

1. Introduction
RepeatSeq determines genotypes for microsatellite repeats in high-throughput sequencing data. RepeatSeq is available
through the Virginia Tech non-commerical license. For more details on the license and use, see license.txt included in
this distribution.

If you use this code, we would be appreciative if cite our manuscript:

G. Highnam, C. Franck, A. Martin, C. Stephens, A. Puthige, and D. Mittelman (2012) Accurate human microsatellite genotypes from high-throughput resequencing data using informed error profiles, Nucleic Acids Res, Epub Oct 22.

Any feedback, comments, or suggestions are greatly appreciated as we develop RepeatSeq further.

2. Setup and Installation
See INSTALL for install instructions

3. Required Input
RepeatSeq requires a BAM file, a FASTA file, and a region file as the minimal parameters. 

4. Optional Input

The user to specify a number of command-line options to customize the behavior of RepeatSeq:

Command-line Options: 
	-r   	    use only a specific read length or range of read lengths (e.g. LENGTH or MIN:MAX)
	-L          required number of reference matching bases BEFORE the repeat [3]
	-R          required number of reference matching bases AFTER the repeat [3]
	-M          minimum mapping quality for a read to be used for allele determination
	-multi      exclude reads flagged with the XT:A:R tag
	-pp         exclude reads that are not properly paired (for PE reads only)
	-error      manually override the RepeatSeq error model and set a constant error rate [0.05]
    	-haploid    assume a haploid rather than diploid genome
	-repeatseq  write .repeatseq file (**see below for more information**)
	-calls      write .calls file (**see below for more information**)
	-t          include user-defined tag in the output filename
	-o          number of flanking bases to output from each read

5. Running RepeatSeq

Usage: repeatseq [options] <in.bam> <in.fasta> <in.regions>,

If an improper command line option is found, RepeatSeq will exit and print usage information.

6. Output Formats for RepeatSeq
RepeatSeq can output a VCF file or two custom output formats: .REPEATSEQ and .CALLS. The VCF file is the only file produced by default, however the other two can be enabled through the “-repeatseq” and “-calls” command line options.

The .calls format is tab delimited and contains repeat annotations, genotypes and confidence values. The genotype field is “NA” when a genotype is not assigned, “N” if the genotype is homozygous with length N, or “NhM” if the genotype is heterozygous with lengths N and M. Similar to the QUAL field in the VCF format, the confidence field here is the phred-scaled quality score for the assertion made in the genotype field, i.e. it gives the value of -10log_10(p_incorrect-call); high values indicate high confidence calls. The TRF string is the concatenated output of Gary Benson's TRF.

Here is a sample .calls file:

[region]	[TRF string]			        [Genotype][Confidence]
2L:6146-6162    5_3.8_4_78_21_20_52_0_0_47_1.00_ATTA    17        39.3627
2L:7006-7017    3_4.0_3_100_0_24_66_0_0_33_0.92_AAT     NA        NA
2L:10589-10595  1_7.0_1_100_0_14_0_0_0_100_0.00_T       7h6       17.5857

The .repeatseq file contains a full annotated alignment of reads to the a reference repeat. Records consist of the following items:

(1) The first line of each record is the headerline, marked with a ~ character. The field label keys are as follows:
○	REF - Reference length
○	A - Alleles present
○	C - Concordance (number of reads that support majority allele - 1 / total reads - 1)
○	D - Total number of reads that span the midpoint of the microsatellite (pre-filtering)
○	R - Reads present after all filters
○	S - Number of reads with no CIGAR sequence present (not included in genotyping)
○	M - Average mapping quality of reads used in genotyping
○	GT - Genotype
○	L - Likelihood; similar to VCF format, it gives the value of -10log_10(p_incorrect-call)

(2) The second line is the reference sequence for quick comparison with read sequences.

(3) Each following line is a read that was used in genotyping. It’s space-delimited with the following fields:
○	Bases leading into the repeat (lowercase 'x' means no base at that position)
○	Bases of the repeat 
○	Bases following the repeat (lowercase 'x' means no base at that position)
○	Start position of the read
○	Read length
○	Number of consecutive bases that match preceding the repeat
○	Number of consecutive bases that match following the repeat
○	Average base quality of the bases of the read (phred scores are converted to base calling probabilities before averaging).
○	Mapping quality of the read
○	Read information flags (p=paired, P=properly paired, u=unmapped, U=mate unmapped, r=reverse strand, R=mate is reversed strand, 1=first mate, 2=second mate, f=failed quality check)
○	CIGAR string
○	Read-ID
